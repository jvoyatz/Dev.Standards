## Reviewer's approach for reviews

As a reviewer, the way you express yourself is extremely important.

*A not ok way to write a comment*
> `Your code is totally wrong here`


*A more acceptable way*
> `I think that there might be a mistake here. I would suggest to discuss it offline.`


Always remember that when you are providing feedback on someone else's code,
you are expressing open your subjective thoughts and aspects on that code.

Using `you` on your comments is a more offensive way and someone might
feel that it gets attached. As a result, you are placing him in an opposite 
position than yours. The author might become defensive, he also might not
recognize your correct point of view, or he might express justifications, even
worse he will reject everything that you 've said. They will try
to prove that your are wrong and finally the won't be open for feedback for you,
now and in the future.

Expressing yourself in a more pleasant and convenient for the others way, using `I`
firstly is a very important.

# Target the code, not the coder

Beware of whom you are targeting with your comments.

A not so ok way
```
You re executing this method more time than it is actually needed and
this comes with performance costs
```

A better one
```
This code block is executed more times, that it is actually needed which comes
with perfomance cost. I would suggest to discuss it offline for further clarification.
```

Only talk about the code and for the person (author). 
Either way, you can't take personally someone's comments for the code, right?
Plus, talking to author that they have in mind that [they are not equal to their code](you-are-not equal-to-your-code), helps. 

Another major advantage from this, is that patterns such as pointing out other devs worked on this
sample before, are avoided. 

Finally, [we are the owners of our code](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeOwnership.html).

### Ask Questions

**Prefer questions over statements.**

Asking someone a question can trigger him to think exhaustively about
the (question's) topic or come with a better idea. In any case, the author
would be more easily open to accept your comments. Furthermore, you might miss
something done for an essential reason and the author can provide more info
with his answer.


### Observation-Impact-Suggestion Feedback

You might find it as SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) 
or (Observation-Impact-Suggestion).

* [The Situation-Behavior-Impactâ„¢ Feedback Tool](ttps://www.mindtools.com/ay86376/the-situation-behavior-impact-feedback-tool)


Provide a certain structure to your feedback, by splitting up
to three parts:
1. Observation
2. Impact
3. Request

#### Observation
You saw something, right;

Try to write your observation in a not offensive way, start a
sentence with an `I...`

Example:
`This code block is executed more that times than actually needed.`

#### Impact
What is the impact of your observation? 

Explain yourself here. Using a sentence with an `I` is not a problem, it is just a comment on a review.

#### Request
What would you suggest?

Write down a better approach on your observation in order to avoid the impact.

This model helps you to provide constructive feedback and open discussions for sharing knowledge.


## Appreciation

Always provide positive feedback for your code you reviewed, even if
there are a little code blocks that deserve it.

In this way, you give motivation to the developer.

Even if there is not anything to be changed, a single line comment indicating
everything is ok does not harm.

In case that you liked some code blocks, but there is a needed change in one of them,
you can start praising the good work of the author, and closing your comment with your suggestions.

## Don't target the Author's style of behavior

You must not critisize and comment on someone's characteristics that result to 
`negative` comments on his code review. Doing this might be understood as
a personal attack from the author.

Each of us comes with a set of attributes, that characterize us. we were born
with some of them and it is not easy to be changed. For this reason, it is often
when we are receiveing feedback to keep a defensive stance and to show 
resistance instead of accepting it. This ends up focusing to the wrong side
of the things instead of finding ways to improve our code.

The point that try not write comments that talk about the behavior 
and the characteristics of the author. Use a proper format and an approach on your messages,
will help (using `I`, talk only about the code or ask questions),

Example:
avoid this
`Please write some more comments, don't be bored!`

prefer this
`I would suggest that in order to keep our code more consistent and increase our test coverarge, it would be better if you have written more tests.`

### Don't comment everything

You don't need to apply critisism on every line of the author's. This approach will
make him keeping a defensive stance and he won't be open for feedback. 
Always focus on the mistakes and the code smells that they are needed to changed.


### Applying a filtering for your feedback

Borrowed from [this talk](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/compassionate-yet-candid-code-reviews/113119451).


There are 3 questions you can ask yourself before writing a comment.


#### Is it true?

don't
```
You should have written more tests!
```

do
```
I think that it would be better if you 've provided more tests
```

#### Is it necessary?

Remember: *Don't comment everything*

don't
```
Fix your missings spaces and your format here.
```
Ok, we can live with them. That means, that is not necessary 
to give such a feedback, except the case of a bigger issue.

#### Is it kind?

Don't attack the author!
Provide your feedback in a proper way.

don't
```
I cannot really understand your code here, take a look on this example.
//...
```

do:
```
I think that this code block is not so clear to me. I would suggest to discuss it offline.
```

### Be open to accept different solutions

Even if your approach might be better than someone else's, that does not
mean that the author's approach is not valid. So, you don't
need to enforce the opposite side to accept your solution.
Remember, that every developer has his own touch on best practices, assumptions.

In the end, there is no need to annoy the author.
