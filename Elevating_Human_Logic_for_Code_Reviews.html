<p>A code review is a powerful tool, used as a mean</p>
<ul>
<li>to improve the quality of the code,</li>
<li>to share and spread knowledge,</li>
<li>to establish guidelines</li>
<li>to maintain code quality</li>
<li>to keep team consistent</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Though, the way code reviews are done can result
to consequences such hurt feelings, brokwn interpersonal relationships.
That is mostly true when done in a wrong way.</em></p>
<p>For this reason, it is important to put human first
approaches on this process.</p>
<p><strong>This document aims to provide advice and guidance
for both the author and the reviewer of a Pull Request (PR), having in mind
constructful, respectful and effective interactions.</strong></p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>An author's mindset</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge exchange</li>
<li>YOu are on the same side
<ul>
<li>Both (author &amp; reviewer) work for the same employer and for the same purpose as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be open to new perspectives/approaches</li>
<li>Be thankful</li>
<li>You are not equal to your code</li>
<li>IKEA Effect</li>
<li>Be humble</li>
</ul>
<p>A reviewer's mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages starting with <code>I</code> not <code>You</code></li>
<li>Give praise</li>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>(Only) Talk about the code</li>
<li>Talk about the behavior</li>
<li>OIR Rule</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authors-approach-for-reviews">Author's approach for reviews</h2>
<p>As an author, you are going to receive feedback for your work. For this reason,
it is important to be open and welcome the others' opinion, as well as to be humble.</p>
<h3 id="humble-what">Humble-what?</h3>
<p>It is normal (and commonly expectedd) to make mistakes, as long as code is written by humans.
Of course, that it does not mean that <br> you should write down your code without giving the appropriate
case. Having a team which consists of developers that accept and admit ther mistakes is desired. <br>
That helps the team to accept comments and critism on a review.</p>
<p>It also helps to avoid having endless discussions &amp; rejections, because some may think that introducing
bugs is seen as something forbidden and keep them hidden. <br>This is the opposite to be open for feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having buds on your code is accepted and recognizing them is desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our profession never stops evolving. You have to admit that nobody's is perfect,
to accept that you can make mistakes and despite how good your are, <br> you can still
learn new things and improve (yourself).</p>
<p>You are not unmistakable or unbuggable and you don't need to link
your credibility as a developer with possible mistakes that can appear in your code.
After all, you are a human, so please <strong>be humble</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, being a member of a team with a leader that can accept critism on
mistakes is crucial. <em>In the end, you always learn from your mistakes.</em></p>
<h3 id="you-are-not-equal-to-your-code">You are not equal to your code</h3>
<p>When someone provides you with comments and critisism on your your code,
it is not a critisism on you personnally. Remember: don't link your reliability with the code
you write. <br> Your personality and your work still counts in your team.
Being a programmer, does not mean that you are perfect in everything from day 1.
<em>As said, it is a never ending evolving skill.</em></p>
<h3 id="you-are-on-the-same-side">You are on the same side</h3>
<p>Read this quote first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Criticism is almost never personal in a professional software engineering environment — it’s usually just part of the process of making a better product.&quot;
<a href="https://book.debuggingteams.com">Fitzpatrick, Collins-Sussman: Debugging Teams, page 16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please make sure that you always have in mind that both the reviewer and you, are on the same side.</p>
<h3 id="ikea-effect">IKEA Effect</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias in which consumers place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created. <br>The name refers to Swedish
manufacturer and furniture retailer IKEA, which sells many items of furniture that require assembly. <em>source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly is this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 2011 study found that subjects were willing to pay 63% more for furniture they had assembled themselves than for equivalent pre-assembled items.[1]
<em>source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is totally ok think of your code as something valuable, probably the best in the market. I am sure that you gave the best of yourself. <br>
Though this, does not mean that your code cannot accept any changes or you might need to refactor a portion of it.
So we need to have in mind the IKEA effect and not being influenced by it.</p>

<h3 id="different-aspectsperspectives-on-your-code">Different Aspects/Perspectives on your Code</h3>
<p>Each developer can have a different technical background, different approaches
on certain things, experiences, etc; <br>That applies as well for the reviewers of your code.
It is quite possible to see your code in an different way that yours. <br>
Plus, your code apporach and its concept is not as common for them as to you.
This, of course does not mean that your code cannot contain a mistake, even a little one.</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<pre><code>@Composable
fun myComposable(card: CardModel){
    if(card.type == CardType.Credit || card.type == CardType.Debit) {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>A common set of questions of the code sample above is</p>
<ul>
<li>When does this take place?</li>
<li>Why having business logic in your composable? I think that we should place it somewhere else</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them are pretty much correct. However the reviewer is not always
able to understand and have the same knowledge of the code as you.</p>
<p>A (better) approach is:</p>
<pre><code>//constants.kt
val billableCards = listOf(CardType.Credit, CardType.Debit)
//or better
fun CardType.isBillableCard(cardType)

val isBillableCard = cardType in billableCards

if(isBillableCard){...}

</code></pre>
<p>The pattern we discuss here is called <strong><a href="https://bloomfire.com/blog/implicit-tacit-explicit-knowledge/">implicit knowledge</a></strong>. It is common and normal for not to be able to see this.<br>
However, it is better that there might be someone that can have a different perspective than yours.
So, welcome the constructive critisism, be open, be humble and thank your reviewers for giving
you different approaches on your code.</p>
<h3 id="exchange-knowledge">Exchange Knowledge</h3>
<p>You are members of the same team (or chapter) and dot't forget that you are working
for the same product.</p>
<p>Code reviews through PRs are a great means to establish standard patterns and conventions, maintain
your architecture and exchange knowledge &amp; best practices. <br> I would say
that you need to think of them a great source of knowledge.</p>
