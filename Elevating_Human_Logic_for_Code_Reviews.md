# Elevating Human Logic for Code Reviews

A code review is a powerful tool, used as a mean 
* to improve the quality of the code, 
* to share and spread knowledge,
* to establish guidelines
* to maintain code quality
* to keep team consistent

*Though, the way code reviews are done can result
to consequences such hurt feelings, brokwn interpersonal relationships.
That is mostly true when done in a wrong way.*

For this reason, it is important to put human first
approaches on this process.

**This document aims to provide advice and guidance
for both the author and the reviewer of a Pull Request (PR), having in mind
constructful, respectful and effective interactions.**


TL;DR

An author's mindset
* Knowledge exchange
* You are on the same side 
  * Both (author & reviewer) work for the same employer and for the same purpose as well
* Be open to new perspectives/approaches
* Be thankful
* You are not equal to your code
* IKEA Effect
* Be humble

A reviewer's mindset: 
* Messages starting with `I` not `You`
* Give praise
* Ask questions
* (Only) Talk about the code
* Talk about the behavior
* OIR Rule

**Soon to provide a cheat sheet here**
