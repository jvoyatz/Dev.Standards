# Intro
Reviewing the code that other developers have written should be considered as an important <br>
part of someone's daily work. There are many reasons for reviewing code applied to the code base:

* New joiners need to get feedback so as to know whether the new code or the changed is consisent
and follows the patterns of the existing code base.

* Devs with less experience need to get feedback as well about the quality of the code that is written.
* Code reviews give someone the capability to share knowledge. It is easier and quicker to explain something on existing code.
* All persons that are working on the certain project ought to have the chance to know about the upcoming interests.


That means that we should consider code reviews as a process and it works better if you have a certain structure for this.

To begin with: 

## Description

Always start the review of a code by taking a look on the description. This 
will help you to get the big idea of the PR and have a better overview of the changes to be done.
A proper PR description should:
* give a reason about the changes
* provide a JIRA link
* contain meaningful commits
* direct the reviewer of what to expect

## Commits
Being able to quickly understand and familiriazed yourself by taking a look at the commits forming
the PR is essentially as well. Though, this is another discussion, but you can take a look [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) about Conventional commits.


## Size of Changes

After being familiarized with requested changes, the next thing that someone should check is the size of changes.
