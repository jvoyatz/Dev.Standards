# Team Meeting `Compose Frenzy` + Team Document `Prodigy`

## Standard Development Practices

It is crucial while working on in bigger teams to apply and maintain a set of common 
practices. Moreover, it is of a high importance to involve the whole team in this process,
where the establishment of this standard should be of universal acceptance as well as it
should reach high quality levels.


**tl;dr**
* First things first, as developers we are familiar to tools like Git, ReadMe files and IDEs.
* With the aim of continuously increasing the team's cohesion, we will arrange a meeting called `Compose Frenzy`
* Following this meeting, everything discussed and agreed in this, will be written in a document called `Prodigy` which
  as a central point of look up
* It is essential for the whole to be involed in this meeting, where we will discuss, debate and decide for certain things.
  In the end, it is about how team approaches certain things or how easy will be the onboarding for a new joiner


### The Background Story

The current format of the teams includes two mobile teams with a variety of seniority between the two platforms. Between the two teams and especially 
for the devs of the Android platform, there is not a standard view/approach/understanding on certain things. For instance, some of the might
follow different coding convetions, code or package structure. Even more, the way that developers understard and perform code reviews is different.
On top of that, the board's goal is to migrate in a team model where mobile devs coexist with other backend/frontend developers, meaning that in the near 
future there will only be full stack teams. 

### The Challenge

That brings us a challenge, which is to `unify` the developers and behave/writing code in a way such
as being in the same team. 

How will we try to overpass this challenge?

* To achieve this, we first need to define a weekly meeting, lets call it Team Talk. 
* In this meeting, we will discuss foρ important topics  of our work, such as Coding Conventions etc. After having agreed on certain things, we will write
  down all this stuff on a certain document, which will server as a central point of reference for every dev of the team. 
  
The whole team should be committed to this document.

The goal?


For the team, the goal is dual:
* it will set their guidelines
* it will be more consistent and unified


Introducing the ...

### The weekly `Compose Frenzy` meeting

Whatever discussed in this meeting, affects every member of the team. So, each memmber should 
be involved in the process of making decision. This is not a meeting for senior devs only, each one's
opinion has an impact, which will help to motivate other developers of the team to participate.

Discussion topics can be:
* Conventions, either naming or something else
* Approaches
* Code Reviews
* Libraries
* Testing

How will each meeting end up?
Each meeting should end up with a solid decision on a certain topic, while the team makes a commitment to.
Apparently,this decision will be written down on a document. 


### The Team's `Prodigy` Document

Given a first templated found on a certain repo in our git host, after having finished a meeting, 
someone will be responsible to write the desicions taken in the meeting.

What will it be written?
A concise description of the decision the team took and not the advantages/disadvantages.
Remember, this document is used for a quick reference on certain topics.


What will we use to write this doc?

Our favorite tools, meaning
1. Git
2. ReadMe files --> .md files
3. An IDE

#### Topics

We can use a dedicated document either a Markdown doc or a Confluence page, where each member
of the team can add a topic that thinks that its impontant to be discussed.

#### Which topic?

In order to select a topic to discuss, we could use a poll in our chat client.
For instance, if the meeting has been scheduled on Wednesday, we could vote 
for a topic at Friday of the previous week.


### Meeting Agreements/Decisions

Okay, the team discusses a certain topic and most of the times,
the member after exchanging opinions and arguments, they will manage
to convince each other.

But what if the team members cannot agree?
Two options:
* Voting
* The leads decide

Majority will not always work, since it is common for the particints to 
not have the same expertise to take a decision. In teams with diffrerent
levels of expertise and roles, this will not work. 
In the end, a majority of the team might not be affected by the decision and can outvote the minority.
It is important to listen to all opinions said and trying as well to ask the introverted
developers.


Sometimes it possibl to exists arguments between people on certain topics and in that case
the leads can take the final decision, since they are responsible for the team.

* Junior or Mid devs should not feel that their vote will not make an impact.
* Leads shoud not decide everything, since actions like this can demotivate the team.


# Last word

What will the team earn from a process like this?

* Each member feels important when participating on team decisions. In other words, acceptance.
* Standardized process,
  * which in turn increase productivity
* Helps the onboarding of new joiners
* Easier debugging
* While performing a review, 
  * in case a dev sees something that might be wrong, it can move the comments discussion on a PR in this meeting
  * or avoid discussing an issue again and again, since it will be already discussed in a meeting
