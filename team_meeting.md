# Team Meeting + Team Document

## Standard Development Practices

To work efficiently, it is crucial to apply and maintain a set of common practices. 
For this reason, a new process needs to be introduced, <br> where the whole team, should participate
in order to establish those practices that would be agreed and followed by everyone. <br>
Those common practices include coding conventions such as package structure and variable naming as well as <br>
the way code reviews are performed.

**tl;dr**

* With the aim of continuously increasing the team's cohesion, we will arrange a meeting called **Android Team Talk**.
* The outcome will be a document ***Android Team Conventions***, used as a point of a reference.
* Each team member's opinion can make an impact and everyone is encouraged to speak up.

## Definition of Process

A new meeting will be introduced, where the guidelines will be agreed. This will be the **_Android Team Talk_** meeting. <br>
The outcome will be a document containing everything discussed and agreed by the team in this meeting. <br> 
This will be the ***Android Team Conventions*** serving as a point of reference for *every Android developer*. <br>
The goal is to work consistently and produce high quality software.


## Definition of **Android Team Talk** meeting

Every team member is encouraged to express their opinion during this meeting. This can motivate other developers, even the introvert ones, <br>
to provide a valuable idea.

Some proposed topics:
* Code Conventions, eg variables naming, code format
* Testing
* Code Reviews
* Programming patterns/approaches

Each decision taken on a topic, will be written down on the **Android Team Conventions** document.

## Definition of **Android Team Conventions** document

### Metadata

This document 
1. could be a **Markdown** file, 
2. written in an IDE (VSCode or Intellij),
3. which will be hosted on a Git Repo and
4. will be reviewed whenever new changes have been committed.

A concise description containing the key points, advantages and disadvantages or things need
to be done or avoided. For instance, <br> considering the *Testing* topic, a developer has to provide a successful and a failed test case and avoid
not to provide any tests at all.


### Topics

The topics that will be discussed in the meeting could be found in a document which can be hosted
on a git repo as well, and every member can propose a new one.

### Which topic to select?

In order to select a topic to discuss in the meeting, a poll could be created at Slack.
If the meeting has been scheduled on Wednesday, the team could vote for the topic
two or three days before.

## **Android Team Talk** decisions

Most of the times, the team will come into an agreement after debating on the topics.
But what if the team members cannot agree? <br>

Then there certain actions to be followed:
* Voting
* Leads input

For example, a team with a variety of seniority might not be able to take 
a decision on a certain topic. In such cases, each side should provide arguments to support their vote. 
However, the final decisions should be taken by the technical leads.

Note that:
* Junior or mid devs should not feel that their vote will not make an impact
* Leads should not decide everything, since actions like this can demotivate the team


## Key Takeaways

What will the team earn from a process like this?

* Team conventions
* Each member feels important when participating on team decisions
* Standardized process, which increases productivity
* Helps the onboarding of new joiners
* Easier debugging & issue tracking
* Improves the resolution of issues found in Code Reviews
